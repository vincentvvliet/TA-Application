Notes week 2
=============
## General information
- process and sprints are really important for this course
- quality of code needs to be high
- we can find a sprint scheleton on brightspace that we need to prepare every week  
- before each week we need to assign issues to members
- doc folder in gitlab -> read lab manual
- assign a chairman + notes taker for every week meeting
## Feedback on requirements
- add admin funcionality (add/delete/modify)
- lecturers can add past TA experience + grades (this data is in the database so the students do not mess it up)
- admin functionality is a could
- lecturers can add/delte/modify their own courses
## Advice for next week
- start the UML diagram (+ database schema)
- decide how to split the scenario to microservices and why (dependencies can be a good hint for what you need a microservice)
- tip : analyse what data we want to store -> split it , assign it to microservices (relations between tables)
- after lecture "Design Patterns" , check first assignment
- minimum 75% code coverage for tests is expected

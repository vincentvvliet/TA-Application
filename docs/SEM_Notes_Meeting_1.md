## Meeting 1

#### UML Diagramme
UML-diagramme: looks good\
-> NVM: convert to lolipop notation\
We have quite a lot of microservices: Add _Authentification_ to _Users_ \
Four services works.

#### Sprint meetings
-> Add all hours(also sprint preparation) to the reflective thing \
-> Begin of week: make sprint \
-> Reflective thing will be used for grading too. (It shows amount of planning) \
-> Already throw in User Stories (based on dependence ordering) 

#### Issues
-> Not complete: Add definition of done, add TO-DO list \
-> Set-up due date for the next week. \
-> You could already add a weight. \
-> Add a time-estimate for all tasks, compare with actual time.

#### DBMS
-> Not in-memory: persistancy \
-> Remote DB: TU Delft, Amazon, Digital Ocean (free $100) 

#### Class Diagramme
Make a class diagramme for only the part that is relevant to the pattern. \
Part for inherticane -> not interesting for DB. 

#### Test coverage
Implementation should ideally be test-driven \
Minimum: 100%

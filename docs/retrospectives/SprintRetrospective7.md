## Week 7
Gijs:
- Issue 22: Quite a lot more of this issue was done this week, mainly the service and controller methods.
	
	Estimated time: see week 6 retrospective.\
	Actual time spent (this week): ~5 hours + 2 on testing.

- Change the Design Pattern: Since appearently we misunderstood the rubric about spring security, we had to make a last minute shift in design pattern. I spent some time on making this change.

	Actual Time Spent: 2 hours.

Ravi:
- I didn't get a lot done this week. I implemented some feedback I got on my merge request. But the rest of my issues depended on the work of others and their work was not done yet. And because this was the week of christmas the others didn't get a lot done either and I was kind of stuck.

Andrei:
- I have mainly focused on finishing issue #15 that I have been assigned the previous week; specifically testing the implementation.
- I have also focused mainly on figuring out testing with mocked servers, which was needed for some methods in the services


---
Tasks Pauline:<br />
- Issue 8: This issue should have been completed but it turned out that a method I wrote has gotten lost so I redid it, and there was some testing missing, so I spent some time testing.

Iarina:
- Iarina had personal circumstances starting from this week (Course staff is aware).
---
Vincent:
- I added the JWT token use in the spring security.
- I updated the entire User Microservice to remove Proxy design pattern.
- I added basic classes

Sprint week 3
Tasks Ravi:<br />
-	`make draft for implementing design patterns`<br />
The first time I tried to make a draft for the design patterns the second lecture on design patterns had not yet been given. This made things quite a bit harder and after a while, I just waited for doing it after the second lecture had been given.

Tasks Iarina: <br />
- For this sprint we mostly tried to plan the architecture and design. We thought we need to plan everything before starting coding. Sadly, this was not the good strategy at all since our team got a bit of a late start. For next sprint we will try to start coding.

Tasks Vincent:
- This week I helped in the planning of the architecture and design of the project, seeing as we were assured that this had to be complete before we could start coding.
- I also added the project template so that when everything else was done, we could start straight away

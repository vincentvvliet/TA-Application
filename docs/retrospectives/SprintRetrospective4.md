-	The process of creating assignment 1 took quite a bit longer than expected. This is partly because we underestimated its size but also because even at the time of finishing it up changes to the architecture were still being made. I had written about (and created a class diagram) of 4 different choices for the design pattern for example. This came about because we first wanted to use the builder design pattern to create the users. We checked this design choice with the TA and all seemed good. But when we thought more about its function in the application we came to the conclusion the User was simply not a complex enough entity to actually get any benefit from the pattern. So we changed the entity the builder pattern was used on to the Contract entity but some group members were of the opinion that that still had the same issue so we changed it again. The design pattern was not the only part where changes were being made but after several revisions, we finally came to a definitive architecture.

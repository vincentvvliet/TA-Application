Sprint week 4
Tasks Gijs: <br />
- Set up database. <br />
	Issues encountered: none really, just navigating Digital Ocean was something new to both me and Iarina.<br />
	<br />
	Estimated time: 2 hours <br />
	Actual time spent: 2+ hours

Tasks Ravi:<br />
-	The process of creating assignment 1 took quite a bit longer than expected. This is partly because we underestimated its size but also because even at the time of finishing it up changes to the architecture were still being made. I had written about (and created a class diagram) of 4 different choices for the design pattern for example. This came about because we first wanted to use the builder design pattern to create the users. We checked this design choice with the TA and all seemed good. But when we thought more about its function in the application we came to the conclusion the User was simply not a complex enough entity to actually get any benefit from the pattern. So we changed the entity the builder pattern was used on to the Contract entity but some group members were of the opinion that that still had the same issue so we changed it again. The design pattern was not the only part where changes were being made but after several revisions, we finally came to a definitive architecture.<br />
	<br />
	Estimated time: 4 hours <br />
	Actual time spent: 7+ hours

-	The creation of assignment 1 had some revisions after finish time noted in the sprint since some changes were being made to the architecture.
Tasks Iarina:<br />
- I finished my tasks and tried to add extra code if possible (we started the project a bit late) since my collegues were busy with exams.
- I encountered problems in creating the entities at some point because the way I configurated the database needed me to add all columns manually. I had some problems with naming for some columns as well. I solved this problems by googling the errors and  adding some basic controllers to test in postman (for seeing if the databases connection is fine)
- I also spent a lot of time in creating the microservicesâ€™ templates. I encountered problems with the build.gradle , since I never touched that beforehand. Google and stackoverflow helped me to add all modules dependancies I needed and configurate a microservice architecture.
- For the next sprint I decided to push people to make work and give them more tasks to do together to learn.  The plans we had in mind, I found not what we needed so I also spend a lot of time to think on how microservices interact.

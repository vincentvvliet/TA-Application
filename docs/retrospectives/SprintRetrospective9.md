## Week 9 (2nd week of christmas break)
Gijs:
- Issue 22 resolving merge conflicts and making changes took me some time

	Estimated time spent: see [Week 6](./SprintRetrospective6.md).\
	Actual time spent: 2 hours.	

- Do POSTMAN tests: I did some testing in POSTMAN to see if the endpoints were actually communicating with eachother, which they did.

	Actual Time spent: 1 hour.
	
- Work on integration testing: Issue we walked into: the fact that our microservices are not mockable in the way we currently have everything set up.

    Actual Time spent: 1 hour

Ravi:
- This week I didn't really have any big hurdles and was able to finish the last of my issues.

Tasks Pauline:<br />
- Vincent needed help resolving problems with user roles, spent about 2 hours on this but couldnt find anything. 
- Spent alot of time resolving merge conflicts for my merge for issue 21, had done this the week before but had to redo it as the target branch was had changed significantly before I was approved.
---
Vincent:
- This week I spent more time debugging the allocation of roles to users. I realised I needed a new perspective so I asked for some help. Unfortunately, neither Pauline or Ravi was able to identify the problem, so it remains open.
- I also worked on integration testing together with Gijs, but unfortunately we realised that we were unable to mock our microservices due to how we created them.
- Resolve merge conflicts for security branch

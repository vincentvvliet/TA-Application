## Week 9 (2nd week of christmas break)
Gijs:
- Issue 22 resolving merge conflicts and making changes took me some time

	Estimated time spent: see [Week 6](./SprintRetrospective6.md).\
	Actual time spent: 2 hours.	

- Do POSTMAN tests: I did some testing in POSTMAN to see if the endpoints were actually communicating with eachother, which they did.

	Actual Time spent: 1 hour.
	
- Work on integration testing: Issue we walked into: the fact that our microservices are not mockable in the way we currently have everything set up.

    Actual Time spent: 1 hour

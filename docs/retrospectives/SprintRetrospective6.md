## Week 6
Gijs:
- Issue 8:  Have endpoints and logic for letting lectureres rate a TA
	Issues encountered. Finished this week.
	
	Estimated time: 2-3 hours.\
	Actual time spent: 4 hours
	
- Issue 22: Have a TA Recommendation System.
    This issue was quite a lot bigger than I expected. I spent the rest of this week on this, and got about half way trough. At the start of this issue I did a lot of thinking on what a good way would be to do this system, and I think this really helped me understand what I had to do. I completly underestimated how much time this issue would take me, as I've not really made a lot of progress yet.

	Estimated time: 6-8 hours\
	Actual time spent: 6 hours. (of which about half was thinking and research)

## Class digrams
 We need to make an overall class digram showing the whole system using the format used in the lecture; level of detail silviu in the diagram has shown us.
 
 Feedback on class diagram we have: we should mention mention all classes in diagrams and how they interact; for example showing servicecontroller passing down request to service, however 5 files for controllers in one microservice can be made to one controller class in diagram, as long as every functional part is shown. 
 Just do what looks good and gievs a good overview. We do have to have detailed class diagrams for every design pattern. We should break up the larger diagram if it gets too big.

## Prototype deadline: 
Deadline for prototype is 17th december; we have one extra week after this to finish everything.

Prototype = everything works roughl; maybe not all could or should requirements are implemented, or testing is not finished.

 ## Other
Silvui has shown us an example of how to implement the databases.
Should we use DTO's? if we think its useful.
On design patterns: the drafts we have shown look good.
